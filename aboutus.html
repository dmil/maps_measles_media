						<h2>About This Project</h2>

					</header>
					<p>Maps, Measles, and Media is an project made as part of the January "Data and Programming for Policy Makers" course at the Harvard Kennedy School. The course took place over two weeks in January 2020, and the entire site, its visualizations, and its background research were completed in this time period. The course was run according to agile methodology and included overviews of web development, command line, github, and data visualization using python and open source code.</p>

					<p>The Maps, Measles, and Media team would like to thank Professor Dhrumil Mehta for his help and for inspiring us to enter policymaking and life not just as consumers, but as producers:</p>

					<blockquote>In the extreme, consumerism is a form of learned helplessness. In consumer culture, making is something we've forgotten we can do. It has pushed us from the mainstream to the margins. However, there's something else available: We can see ourselves as producers. In maker culture, we define ourselves based on what we can do, and what we can learn to do.
